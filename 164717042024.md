To print the contents of a text file, you can use the `File.ReadAllText(string filepath)` function.  

This function stores all of the text in a file in a string. The usage would be:  

```
string fileContent = File.ReadAllText(filePath)  
```

The `filepath` parameter is the path to the file you would like to read.  

The content of the file can then be printed to the console window using `Console.WriteLine(fileConent)`
