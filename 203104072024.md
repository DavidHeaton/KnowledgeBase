%Checking that a program exists on the system with go

I needed to check if Vim was installed on my system and come up with the
function that will do that. I am sure that this function can be altered to check
for any program.  

```
func checkVim() bool {
	cmd := exec.Command("vim", "--version")

	err := cmd.Run()

	if err != nil {
		return false
	} else {
		return true
	}
}

```

The function runs the vim with the `--version` option and checks if there is an
error returned by the `cmd.Run()` function, indicating that the program is not
present on the system, or that is is not running correctly.
