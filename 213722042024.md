# Use of BODMAS and brackets

When several operations are combined the order of operations in which they are performed is important.

For example,  

$$12 + 21 \times 3$$

might be interpreted in two different ways:  

> add 12 to 21 then multiply the result by 3  
> $12 + 21 = 33$  
> $33 \times 3 = 99$  

> multply 21 by 3 than add the result to 12  
> $21 \times 3 = 63$  
> $63 + 12 = 75$

We carry out the operations according to `BODMAS`. This is an acronym that reminds us in which order to carry out operations.  

- **B**rackets
- **O**rder
- **D**ivision
- **M**ultiplication
- **A**ddition
- **S**ubtraction

Applying `BODMAS` to the above example, the result of the multiplication ($12 \times 3$) is found first and then added to $12$
