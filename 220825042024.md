## The Boyer-Moore algorithm
The Boyer-Moore algorithm is an efficient string search algorithm for that seeks
to reduce the number of character comparisons required to find a substring
withing a larger string. It achieves this efficiency by utilising two key
heuristics: the "bad character rule" and the "good suffix rule"

1. The Bad Character Rule.
    - This heuristic involves scanning the pattern from right to left. When
      a mismatch occurs between the character in the text and the character in
      the pattern, the algorithm shifts the pattern to the right such that the
      rightmost occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern aligns with
      the mismatched character in the text.
    - If the mismatched character in the text is not present in the pattern, the
      pattern is shifted by the length of the pattern itself.
2. The Good Suffix Rule.
    - This heuristic involves considering the suffix of the pattern that matches
      the text substring to the right of the mismatch.
    - If this suffix also appears elsewhere in the pattern, the algorithm shifts
      the patterns such that the rightmost occurrence of the matching suffix
      aligns with the matching substring in the text.
    - If no such occurrence is found, the algorithm shifts the pattern by the entire length of the pattern.

By applying these heuristics, the Boyer-Moore algorithm is able to skip
unnecessary character comparisons and make larger shifts in the pattern,
resulting in improved efficiency, particularly for larger patterns and texts.

Text: "ABABCABABCDABABCABAB" 
Pattern: "ABABCABAB"

1. Start comparing the pattern with the text from right to left.
    When a mismatch occurs:
    - Apply the bad character rule to determine the shift based on the last
      occurrence of the mismatched character in the pattern.
    - Apply the good suffix rule to determine any additional shifts based on
      matching suffixes.
2. Repeat the process until either the pattern is found or the end of the text
is reached.

Implementing the Boyer-Moore Algorithm in Go involves translating these rules
into code to efficiently search for substrings within larger strings. The
algorithm typically achieves linear or sub-linear time complexity in practical
scenarios, making it one of the most efficient string searching algorithms
available.
