%Running other programs from a Go program

I have a example of how to run a program from a running Go program:  

```
func openKnowledgeBaseFile(path string) {
	cmd := exec.Command("vim", path)
	cmd.Stdout = os.Stdout
	cmd.Stdin = os.Stdin
	cmd.Stderr = os.Stderr
	err := cmd.Run()

	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Could not open file")
		os.Exit(1)
	}
}
```

This function takes the path of a file and opens that file with vim.  
I had problems getting it to run with the `stdin`, `stdout` and `stderr` parts
of the code.  

It seems that the exec command function returns a 'Command', the parameters
passed the function (in this case 'vim' and 'path', seem to be the name of the
program we wish to run and any command-line parameters that are used by the
program.

The `Cmd.Stdin` statements seem to set `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` that the
program uses.

The program is then run using the `cmd.Run()` function. This function returns an
error if the program did not run correctly, which is used in the code to exit
the program gracefully (with `os.Exit(1)`).
