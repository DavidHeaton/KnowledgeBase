This question was posed in the 'Green light test' for bookkeeping fundamentals:  

**What are the potential effects of processing supplier transactions in an
untimely manner?**  

- [ ] Delayed receipt of goods from suppliers
- [ ] Expenses will be overstated
- [ ] Incorrect payment to suppliers
- [ ] Delayed payments to suppliers
- [ ] Loss of supplier's goodwill

## **Delayed receipt of goods from suppliers**

There will almost certainly be a delay receiving goods from the suppliers. The
supplier is unlikely to send goods if they do not have the documents that will
be produced when the transaction is processed.

## **Expenses will be overstated**

If the processing of the transaction is delayed, this does not affect the amount
of the transaction, thus the expenses cannot be overstated (assuming the amounts
in the transaction are correct).

## **Incorrect payment to suppliers**

Again if the amounts of the transaction are accurate, the payment will be
correct. The delay causes late payment to the suppliers.

## **Delayed payment to suppliers**

As noted above, the payment will be delayed.

## **Loss of supplier goodwill**

There will be a loss of goodwill with the supplier if they do not get paid on
time.
