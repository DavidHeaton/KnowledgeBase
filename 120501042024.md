There are five fundamental principles of ethics that the AAT has.  

These are:  

 - **Confidentiality:** We must respect the confidentiality of the information
   we have when we form professional and business relationships. Also, we must
   no use information that we have for personal advantage, or for that of anyone
   else.
 - **Professional Behaviour:** We must comply with relevant laws and regulations
   and avoid any action that bring the profession into disrepute.
 - **Professional Competence and due care:** We must maintain professional
   knowledge and skill to ensure that we provide a competent and professional
   service. This means keeping up to date with current developments in practice,
   legislation and techniques.
 - **Integrity:** We must be straightforward and honest in all professional and
   business relationships.
 - **Objectivity:** We must not allow bias, conflict of interest or the
   influence of others to affect professional or business judgements.
