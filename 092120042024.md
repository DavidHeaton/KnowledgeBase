> - Quotation 

- _A Purchase order is sent by the customer to the supplier confirming the goods they want to buy. This is the probable answer._

- _A Invoice Is sent to the customer by the supplier, it details the good or services purchased and the amount owed by the customer. This is the probable answer._
- A credit note is sent to the customer to alter the amount owed on an invoice. It details the reason for the alteration. This is not the correct answer as it does not detail the amount owing.
- Delivery note is sent to the customer with a delivery of goods and services. This does not detail the amount owed. This is not the correct answer.
- Cash Receipt is used to confirm a cash purchase. It relates to a cash transaction so there would not be an amount owing as the full amount would be paid in full at the time of purchase.

> - Delivery Note
> - Quotation
> - Purchase Order
> - Good recieved note

This is a quotation. As O'Leary Ltd has offered to supply the chairs, they are the supplier and the James Jones is a customer. A document that is sent to the customer by the supplier detailing goods or services offered and the cost of those goods or services is a quotation.

## Question 7

A Remittance note would have been helpful in this situation

1. False
1. True
1. True **THIS IS INCORRECT - A credit note can show the unit price of goods returned. ::tag::incorrect**
1. True

## Question 9

> You have started preparing a sales invoice and got as far as calculating that the total net amount is £245. The customer has bought a large number of items and is to be given a 6% bulk discount.

The value of the discount is $£245 \times \frac{6}{100} = £14.70$ so the total net amount after discount is $£245 - £14.70 = £230.30$.

VAT, charged at the standard rate of 20% is $£230.30 \times \frac{20}{100} = 46.06$, giving an invoice total of $£230.30 + £46.06 = £276.36$

## Question 10

> Delivery notes are sent by customers. Is this true or false?

False.
