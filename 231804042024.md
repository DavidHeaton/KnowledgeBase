## Understanding the role of the bookkeeper

**What are the potential effects of processing supplier transactions in an untimely manner?**  

1. [X] Delayed receipt of goods from suppliers
2. [ ] Expenses will be overstated
3. [ ] Incorrect payment to suppliers
4. [X] Delayed payments to supplier
5. [X] Loss of suppliers' goodwill

The supplier will not send out goods until the transaction is processed, resulting in a delay of receipt of goods.

Option 2. Overstatement of expenses will not be affected, assuming the transaction is correct.

Option 3, assuming all documents in the transaction are accurate, there should not be any incorrect payments.

Option 4, if processing of transactions is delayed, there will certainly be a delay in the payment to suppliers

Option 5, the supplier will not be happy with a delay in processing of a transactions, as they will be owed money. So a loss of goodwill may follow.
