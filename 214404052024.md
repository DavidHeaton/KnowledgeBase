Here is a summary of the process to remove a file from tracking in Git
and from the remote repository:

1. **Identify the file to be removed**: Determine the filename(s) that you want
to stop tracking and remove from the remote repository.

2. **Update `.gitignore` (if necessary)**: If the file(s) you want to remove are
not supposed to be tracked in the future, add their filenames to the
`.gitignore` file in the root directory of your repository.

3. **Remove file from tracking**: Use the `git rm --cached` command followed by
the filename(s) to remove the file(s) from being tracked by Git while keeping
them in your working directory. For example:

```
   git rm --cached sc.exe
 ```

4. **Commit changes**: Commit the changes to reflect the removal of the file(s)
from tracking. Use `git commit -m "Remove <filename> from tracking"` to commit
the changes with a descriptive message.

5. **Push changes to remote repository**: Push the commit containing the removal
of the file(s) to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`,
replacing `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you are working on.

Following these steps will ensure that the file(s) are no longer tracked by Git
and are removed from the remote repository while keeping them in your local
working directory.
